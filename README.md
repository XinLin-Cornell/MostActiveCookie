## Requirements
Given a cookie log file in the following format:
```

AtY0laUfhglK3lC7,2018-12-09T14:19:00+00:00 
SAZuXPGUrfbcn5UA,2018-12-09T10:13:00+00:00

```
Write a command line program in your preferred language to process the log file and return the most active cookie for specified day. The example below shows how we'll execute your program.

**Command:**
```
$ ./most_active_cookie cookie_log.csv -d 2018-12-09
```
**Output:**
```
AtY0laUfhglK3lC7
```

## Assumptions
- If multiple cookies meet that criteria, please return all of them on separate lines.
- You're only allowed to use additional libraries for testing, logging and cli-parsing. There are libraries for most languages which make this too easy (e.g pandas) and weâ€™d like you to show off you coding skills.
- You can assume -d parameter takes date in UTC time zone.
- You have enough memory to store the contents of the whole file.
- Cookies in the log file are sorted by timestamp (most recent occurrence is first line of the file).

## Running Instructions
- Make sure you have installed Java JDK on your computer.
- Open Terminal, direct to the project home directory, then type the following:
```
$ cd mostActiveCookie/src
$ javac most_active_cookie.java
```
- Run the following command with a specified day to get desired output, e.g.
```
$ java most_active_cookie cookie_log.csv -d 2018-12-09
```
This command return the most active cookie for Dec 9th 2018.
